    <p>The ear favors no particular "point of view." We are enveloped by sound. It forms a seamless web around us. We say, "Music shall fill the air." We never say, "Music shall fill a particular segment of the air."
    We hear sounds from everywhere, without ever having to focus. Sounds came from "above", from "below", from in "front" of us, from"behind" us, from our "right", from our "left". We can't shut out sound automatically. We simply are not quipped with earlids. where a visual space is an organised continuum of a uniformed connected kind, the ear world is a world of simultaneous relationships. </p>

    <p>How much do you make? Have you ever contemplated suicide? Are you now or have you ever been...? Are you aware of the fact...? I have here before me...Electrical information devices for universal, tynnical womb-to-tomb surveillance are causing a very serious dilemma between our claim to know. The older, traditional ideas of private, isolated thoughts and actions - the patterns of mechanistic technologies - are very seriously threatened by new methods of instantaneous electric information retrieval, by the electrically computerized dossier bank-that one big gossip column that is unforgiving, unforgetful and from which there is no redemption, no erasure of early "mistakes." We have already reached a point where remedial control, born out of knowledge of media and their total effects on all of us, must be exerted. How shall the new environment be programmed now that we have become so involved with each other, now that all of us have become the unwitting work force for social change? What's that buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzing? </p>
